# Rhy-Pressed
A tempo-based arcade-style game that is run on a Alchitry Au FPGA.

## Gameplay
A sequence of coloured LEDs will light up and Player should press on the buttons of the right colours at the right time.
There are 3 levels of difficulty in this version:
1. Easy (The typical tempo-based game, all the LEDs light up throughout the gameplay)
2. Medium (The LEDs will continuously blink throughout the gameplay)
3. Extreme (Instead of blinking, the LEDs will show an entirely different sequence to trick the Player :D)

## Development
This game was developed in Lucid, a hardware description language (HDL) similar to Verilog, using Alchitry's IDE.
It was developed as a part of our 50.002 Computation Structures course in SUTD.
